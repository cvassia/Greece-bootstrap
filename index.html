        Greece is a country in Southern Europe,bordered to the north by Albania,
        North Macedonia and Bulgaria; to the east by Turkey, and is surrounded
        to the east by the Aegean Sea, to the south by the Cretan and the Libyan
        Seas, and to the west by the Ionian Sea which separates Greece from
        Italy. The country consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland

          <ul class="read-more-wrap">
            <li>
              Macedonia is the largest and second-most-populous Greek region,
              with a population of 2.38 million in 2017. The region is highly
              mountainous, with most major urban centres such as Thessaloniki
              and Kavala being concentrated on its southern coastline. Macedonia
              incorporates most of the territories of ancient Macedon, a kingdom
              ruled by the Argeads and whose most celebrated members were
              Alexander the Great and his father Philip II. The name Macedonia
              was later applied to a number of widely-differing administrative
              areas in the Roman and Byzantine empires, resulting in modern
              geographical Macedonia.The region remains an important economic
              centre for Greece.

            <li class="read-more-target">
              Macedonia accounts for the majority of Greece's agricultural
              production and is also a major contributor to the country's
              industrial and tourism sectors. Central Macedonia is Greece's
              fourth-most-popular tourist region and the most popular region
              that is not an island. It is home to four UNESCO World Heritage
              sites, including Aigai, one of the ancient Macedonian capital
              cities. Pella, which replaced Aigai as the capital of Macedon in
              the fourth century BC, is also located in Greek Macedonia.

          <ul class="read-more-wrap">
            <li>
              Epirus, is a traditional geographic and modern administrative
              region in northwestern Greece. It borders the regions of West
              Macedonia and Thessaly to the east, West Greece to the south, the
              Ionian Sea and Ionian Islands to the west and Albania to the
              north. It is part of the wider historical region of Epirus, which
              overlaps modern Albania and Greece but lies mostly within Greek
              territory. Epirus, like the region as a whole, is rugged and
              mountainous. It comprises the land of the ancient Molossians and
              Thesprotians. It is largely made up of mountainous ridges, part of
              the Dinaric Alps. The region's highest spot is on Mount Smolikas,
              at an altitude of 2.637 metres above sea level.

              In the east, the Pindus Mountains that form the spine of mainland
              Greece separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly. Most of Epirus
              lies on the windward side of the Pindus. The winds from the Ionian
              Sea offer the region more rainfall than any other part of Greece.
              The Vikos-Aoos and Pindus National Parks are situated in the
              Ioannina Prefecture of the region. Both areas have imposing
              landscapes of dazzling beauty as well as a wide range of fauna and
              flora. The climate of Epirus is mainly alpine. The vegetation is
              made up mainly of coniferous species. The animal life is
              especially rich in this area and includes, among other species,
              bears, wolves, foxes, deer and lynxes.

              Thessaly lies in northern Greece and borders the regions of
              Macedonia on the north, Epirus on the west, Central Greece on the
              south and the Aegean Sea on the east. Thessaly is a traditional
              geographic and modern administrative region of Greece, comprising
              most of the ancient region of the same name. Before the Greek Dark
              Ages, Thessaly was known as Aeolia , and appears thus in Homer's
              Odyssey. Thessaly became part of the modern Greek state in 1881,
              after four and a half centuries of Ottoman rule. The capital of
              the region is Larissa. In Homer's epic, the Odyssey, the hero
              Odysseus visited the kingdom of Aeolus, which was the old name for
              Thessaly. The Plain of Thessaly, which lies between Mount

          <p>
            Continental Greece, colloquially known as Roúmeli, is a traditional
            geographic region of Greece. In English the area is usually called
            Central Greece, but the equivalent Greek term is more rarely used.
            It includes the southern part of the Greek mainland (sans the
            Peloponnese), as well as the offshore island of Euboea. Central
            Greece is the most populous geographical region of Greece, with a
            population of 4,591,568 people, and covers an area of 24,818.3 km²,
            making it the second largest of the country. It is located to the
            north of the Peloponnese and to the south of Thessaly and Epirus,
            bordering the Aegean Sea to the east, the Ionian Sea to the west and
            the Corinthian Gulf to the south. Its climate is temperate along its
            coastlines, and dry in the interior.

          <ul class="read-more-wrap">
            <li>
              The Peloponnese is a peninsula and geographic region in southern
              Greece. It is connected to the central part of the country by the
              Isthmus of Corinth land bridge which separates the Gulf of Corinth
              from the Saronic Gulf. During the late Middle Ages and the Ottoman
              era, the peninsula was known as the Morea , a name still in
              colloquial use in its demotic form. The peninsula is divided among
              three administrative regions: most belongs to the Peloponnese
              region, with smaller parts belonging to the West Greece and Attica
              regions. Since antiquity, and continuing to the present day, the
              Peloponnese has been divided into seven major regions: Achaea
              (north), Corinthia (northeast), Argolis (east), Arcadia (center),
              Laconia (southeast), Messenia (southwest), and Elis (west). Each
              of these regions is headed by a city. The largest city is Patras
              (pop. 170,000) in Achaia, followed by Kalamata (pop. 55,000) in
              Messenia. The peninsula has been inhabited since prehistoric
              times.

            <li class="read-more-target">
              Its modern name derives from ancient Greek mythology, specifically
              the legend of the hero Pelops, who was said to have conquered the
              entire region. The name Peloponnesos means "Island of Pelops". The
              Mycenaean civilization, mainland Greece's (and Europe's) first
              major civilization, dominated the Peloponnese in the Bronze Age
              from its stronghold at Mycenae in the north-east of the peninsula.
              The Mycenean civilization collapsed suddenly at the end of the 2nd
              millennium BC. Archeological research has found that many of its
              cities and palaces show signs of destruction. The subsequent
              period, known as the Greek Dark Ages, is marked by an absence of
              written records.

            <li>
              The Ionian Islands are a group of islands in Greece. They are
              traditionally called the Heptanese, i.e. "the Seven Islands", but
              the group includes many smaller islands as well as the seven
              principal ones. As a distinct historic region they date to the
              centuries-long Venetian rule, which preserved them from becoming
              part of the Ottoman Empire, and created a distinct cultural
              identity with many Italian influences. The islands were settled by
              Greeks at an early date, possibly as early as 1200 BC, and
              certainly by the 9th century BC. The early Eretrian settlement at
              Kerkyra was displaced by colonists from Corinth in 734 BC. The
              islands were mostly a backwater during Ancient Greek times and
              played little part in Greek politics. The one exception was the
              conflict between Kerkyra and its mother-City Corinth in 434 BC,
              which brought intervention from Athens and triggered the
              Peloponnesian War. Ithaca was the name of the island home of
              Odysseus in the epic Ancient Greek poem the Odyssey by Homer.

              Attempts have been made to identify Ithaki with ancient Ithaca,

          <h5>Creta</h5>
          <p>
            Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island
            in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located in the southern part of the
            Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea. Crete forms a
            significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece,
            while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own
            poetry and music). It was once the centre of the Minoan civilisation
            (c. 2700–1420 BC), which is the earliest known civilisation in
            Europe. The palace of Knossos lies in Crete.The island is first
            referred to as Kaptara in texts from the Syrian city of Mari dating
            from the 18th century BC,repeated later in Neo-Assyrian records and
            the Bible (Caphtor). It was also known in ancient Egyptian as
            Keftiu, strongly suggesting a similar Minoan name for the island.
            The current name of Crete is thought to be first attested in
            Mycenaean Greek texts written in Linear B, through the words
            ke-re-te. In Ancient Greek, the name Crete first appears in Homer's
            Odyssey.Its etymology is unknown. One proposal derives it from a
            hypothetical Luwian word, *kursatta.

              Kos and Patmos are historically the more important; the remaining
              twelve are Agathonisi, Astypalaia, Chalki, Kalymnos, Karpathos,
              Kasos, Leipsoi, Leros, Nisyros, Symi, Tilos, and Kastellorizo.
              Other islands in the chain include Alimia, Arkoi, Chalki,
              Farmakonisi, Gyali, Kinaros, Levitha, Marathos, Nimos, Pserimos,
              Saria, Strongyli, Syrna and Telendos. The Dodecanese have been
              inhabited since prehistoric times. In the Neopalatial period on
              Crete, the islands were heavily Minoanized. Following the downfall
              of the Minoans, the islands were ruled by the Mycenaean Greeks
              from circa 1400 BC, until the arrival of the Dorians circa 1100
              BC. It is in the Dorian period that they began to prosper as an
              independent entity, developing a thriving economy and culture
              through the following centuries. By the early Archaic period
              Rhodes and Kos emerged as the major islands in the group, and in
              the 6th century BC the Dorians founded three major cities on
              Rhodes.

          <h5>Cyclades</h5>
          <p>
            The Cyclades are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of
            mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece.
            They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean
            archipelago. The name refers to the islands around the sacred island
            of Delos. The largest island of the Cyclades is Naxos. The
            significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is
            best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands'
            pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age
            Minoan civilization arose in Crete to the south. A distinctive
            Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements
            arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer and
            wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were
            apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites
            include Saliagos and Kephala (on Kea) with signs of copperworking,
            Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few
            thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty
            oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter),
            and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the
            islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos,
            which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout
            antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.

          <h5>North Aegean islands</h5>
          <ul class="read-more-wrap">
            <li>
              The North Aegean islands are a number of disconnected islands in
              the north Aegean Sea, also known as the Northeast Aegean islands,
              belonging to Greece and Turkey. The islands do not form a physical
              chain or group, but are frequently grouped together for tourist or
              administrative purposes. To the south are the Dodecanese islands;
              and to the west are the Cyclades and Sporades islands. Within this
              group, the main islands in the northeastern Aegean Sea and along
              the Turkish coast are the Greek islands of Samos, Ikaria, Chios,
              Lesbos, Lemnos, Agios Efstratios, Psara, Fournoi Korseon,
              Oinousses and the Turkish islands of Imbros, Tenedos and the
              Rabbit or Tavşan Islands. The main islands in the Thracian Sea in
              the far north are the Greek islands of Samothrace and Thasos. From
              the Mesolithic Age, the North Aegean, as indeed the entire Aegean,
              ceased to be an obstacle and became a bridge joining the
              inhabitants of the region. Shipping, trade, economy, culture and
              social interactions developed in the archipelago and surrounding
              areas on the basis of communication and contact between the
              inhabitants. This was especially true after the permanent
              settlement of the islands 5000 years BC. The islands of the north
              Aegean were in such a position that shipping and trade contributed
              greatly to the development of a significant culture.
            </li>
            <li class="read-more-target">
              The culture reaches its peak around 3000BC. The growth of
              settlements such as Poliochnis in Lemnos, Emporiou in Chios and
              Iraiou in Samos, amongst others, are evidence of the importance of
              these centers at this time. By ca. 2000 BC the Ionians had
              installed themselves in Chios while Samos and Lesvos are in the
              hands of the Achaeans. In the late 12th and early 11th centuries
              BC, a time when vast numbers of the people moved to Greece, the
              Aioleis arrived in Lesvos.

            The fish dishes are the best ones as Greece is a country surrounded
            by the sea and fishing is a main factor of the Greek agriculture. Of
            course the lobsters, shrimps and red mullets (Barbounia) are the
            most popular, but there are many other kind of fishes like Tsipoura
            (sea bream), Lithrinia (red sea breams) Fagria, Melanouria, Sargi
            and Synagrides all of those fishes belong to the breams and porgies
            family, very tasty grilled or fried. In the summer you will find in
            the Greek taverns many Mackerels (kolioi) But the special fish that
            the Greek love is marida or maridaki the Greek equivalent of the
            north Atlantic Whitebait, this is one of the tastiest fish dishes
            and the best companion for Retsina wine. Other common fish foods in
            Grece are the Kalamaris (squids) , Gopes (bogues) , Htapodi
            (octopus) grilled or boiled with vinegar, Gavros (a kind of anchovy)
            , Galeos (Smooth Hound) tasty fillets that served most with garlic
            salad (scordalia) and beetroots and finally Xifias (Sword fish) a
            very common fish in the Aegean. The Greek bouillabaisse with first
            class fishes most of the times especially in the summer has to be
            ordered a day before in many taverns and restaurants.

            veal and rabbit.Many meat dishes are cooked in tomatoes and red wine
            and others in lemon such as lamb fricasse, which is lamb cooked with
            endives or romaine lettuce and an egg-lemon sauce. Garlic is used
            heavily as are onions and potatoes in the many stews and oven baked
            dishes. There is a pork dish similar to fricasse which is made with
            celery and served in the winter called hirino me celino. Dolmades
            (stuffed grape leaves), kolokithia gemista, (stuffed zuchinni),
            tomates ke peperies gemista (stuffed tomatoes and peppers) and
            laxano gemista (stuffed cabbage) are other examples of stretching
            the meat by using it with rice and vegetables. Pastitsio is like
            lasagna though not as saucy and is made with pasta, ground beef,
            tomatoes, onions and garlic and béchamel sauce. Giovetsi is lamb
            baked with orzo pasta and tomato sauce. If one has been to an Easter
            dinner in Greece you undoubtedly have memories of the men standing
            around watching the lamb turning over the hot coals, usually kept
            company by a kokoretsi, the intestines of the lamb stuffed with
            organ meat and also spit-roasted. Usually this takes place outdoors
            on Easter Sunday.Also popular is gourounopoulo, which is roast
            suckling pig.

            One of the greatest foods that you can ever taste is the flavorful
            cake with syrup, called “Greek ravani.” It is made from semolina and
            orange syrup. A single visit to a Greek house will probably lead to
            someone offering you a small, decorated, glass plate with syrup on
            it. The treat is considered too sugary, so it is served by the
            spoonful. If you happen to be in Thessaloniki, you have to taste the
            “bougatsa.” A custard pie with phyllo is an amazing breakfast and a
            locals’ favorite. In the Greek pastries of Thessaloniki, you can
            also taste a Greek rice pudding called “rizogalo.” Greek halva is a
            semolina pudding with raisins which takes you to an absolute trip of
            flavors. Depending on the place, Greek halva can also be flour-based
            or sesame-based. A sweet pastry made of very thin layers of phyllo,
            filled with nuts and covered with syrup is, maybe, the most famous
            Greek dessert in the world, baklava. Of course, you cannot visit a
            Greek city, village or island and leave without eating some of the
            most well-known Greek desserts. These Greek honey puffs
            (loukoumades) are small, deep fried balls of dough with honey on
            top.

                The first written Greek letters were found on baked mud tablets,
                in the remains of the Minoan Knossos Palace of Crete island.
                This language is known as Linear A and it has not been fully
                decoded till today. The most famous example of Linear A is
                written in the famous Phaestos Disc. In the 12th century BC, a
                new language started to develop, called Linear B, where each
                drawing symbol is a consonant-vowel combination. Linear B dates
                from the Mycenaean civilization. In the late 9th and early 8th
                century BC, the language found was based on the Phoenician
                syllabary, written from left to right and back again.

              <h5>The Classical Period</h5>
              <p>
                During the Classical period (6th-4th century BC), the territory
                of Greece was divided in numerous states and each one had its
                own dialect. The two more important dialects were the Ionic and
                the Attic. During this period, Athens established itself as the
                political, economical and cultural centre of the Greek world,
                and therefore the Attic idiom started to be used as a common
                language.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the expeditions of Alexander the Great, Attic dialect was
                also expanded in the depths of the East and it was spoken by
                millions of people. This gradually led to a mixing dialect which
                was the beginning of the koine, or common dialect, mostly known
                as the Hellenistic koine. This type of language survived through
                centuries and became an official language of the Roman Empire
                later on. The koine is the original language of the New
                Testament and the basis for the development of Medieval and
                Modern Greek. This language was developed all through the
                Byzantine times.

              <h5>Katharevousa and Dimotiki</h5>
              <p>
                With the creation of the modern Greek State in 1829, the
                question of the language, as an important part of the
                nation-building process, had to be resolved. After about 4
                centuries of Ottoman occupation, Greece had mostly an oral
                culture due to all these centuries of different dominations. The
                question was the choice of language used in administration and
                education. One of the suggestions, to re-use the Attic language,
                was very attractive, especially because all the Western Europe
                was charmed by the Ancient Greek culture, and it would have been
                a great stimulus for the philhellenes. It proved impossible from
                a practical point of view.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, the Greek scholar Adamantios Korais (1748-1833), suggested
                to reform the spoken language of those times on ancient
                principals. This suggestion was accepted and the katharevoussa
                (meaning purified language) was created. The theme became
                politicized: a distinction rose between the katharevoussa, which
                became the high-style language associated with official
                functions such as governmental affairs, education and religion,
                and the dimotiki language (popular language) used by common
                people in their everyday life. Source: www.greeka.com

              <h5>20th century language</h5>
              <p>
                In the 20th century, the Greek language debate took a huge
                political significance: academics were sacked for using
                dimotiki, riots were taking place in the streets and a lot of
                people were claiming that katharevoussa was being used as an
                instrument of denying access to education to the common people.
                Nationalist governments like the dictator of the Junta, Ioannis
                Papadopoulos, favoured katharevoussa. The struggle between the
                proponents of dimotiki and katharevoussa riased various social
                attitudes and political positions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The theme was eventually solved in 1976, with actions of the
                after dictatorship government. Dimotiki language was adopted in
                education and administration and it has been kept since then as
                the formal language of modern Greece. The last thing worth
                mentioning is that most regions in Greece have their local oral
                dialects, never used as writing means. Every region has of

              <p>
                The religion of Greek people is an important aspect of the Greek
                culture. The Greek population in mainland Greece and the Greek
                islands is Christian Orthodox per 98%. The religion of rest of
                the population is Muslims, Catholic and Jewish. Greece and
                Russia are the only countries to have such a great proportion of
                Orthodox population. The Orthodox Church forms the third largest
                branch of Christianity, after the Roman Catholics and the
                Protestants. You will find bellow information about the history
                of Orthodox religion in Greece.

                According to the history of Orthodoxy, the first who came in the
                Greek territory to preach Christianity was Saint Paul in 49 AD.
                Although many people converted to Christianity in the centuries
                that followed, this didn't become an official religion until the
                Emperor Constantine the Great established Christianity as the
                official religion of the Byzantine Empire.

              <h5>The Schism</h5>
              <p>
                In 1054 AD, Christianity was divided in Eastern and Western
                Church, the Orthodox and the Catholics. This division was called
                "The Schism" and was the result of long disputes between the
                Pope of Rome and the Patriarch of Constantinople. The disputes
                referred to the celibacy of the clergy (Catholic priests had to
                remain unmarried, whereas the orthodox priests could marry
                before becoming ordained), receiving the Holy Communion and the
                wording of the Creed: for the Orthodox the Holy Spirit proceeds
                from the Father, whereas Rome added and the Son (filioque).
                However, the largest problem between the two Churches was the
                demand of the Pope to have full control over the Eastern
                Patriarchs (of Constantinople, of Alexandreia and of Antioche).

                As mentioned, 98% of the Greek population is Christian Orthodox.
                A percentage of 1,3% are Greek citizens of Muslim religion,
                mostly people living in Thrace who were not affected by the
                population exchange of 1922 between the Greeks of Asia Minor and
                the Turks of Greece. The rest 0,7% are Catholics, Jewish,
                Jehovah's Witnesses and others. Most Catholics live on the
                island of Syros, a remain from the Venetian occupation of
                Cyclades in the Medieval times.

                Music in Greece is of unbelievable diversity due to the creative
                Greek assimilation of different influences of the Eastern and
                Western cultures of Asia and Europe. Music is an important
                aspect of the daily Greek culture. It has a long history dating
                from the Antiquity, during which poetry, dancing and music were
                inseparable and played an important part in the ancient Greek's
                everyday life. The Greek tragedy used music as one of its
                component elements. Then, with the fall of Ancient Greece and
                the evolution of the Byzantine Empire, Greece music got a more
                ecclesiastical approach. In the 400 years of Ottoman domination,
                it was influenced by the eastern sounds. It got reborn only in
                the 19th century with the opera compositions of Nikolaos
                Mantzaros (1795-1872) and Spyros Samaras (1861-1917). From that
                moment on, Greece produced many talented artists, including
                great composers to fabulous interprets. Music in Greece became
                an expression and a testimony of the slavery years, a weapon of
                opposition against the colonel authority and a way to express
                love, death, human fears, that accompanied the Greeks in their
                everyday life.

              <h2>Music Types</h2>
              <h5>Folk Songs</h5>
              <p>
                Greek folk song sees its origins coming from the time of ancient
                Greek poetry and music. It can be divided into two musical
                movements: the akritic and the klephtic. The akritic style dates
                from the 9th century AD and it was created to express the life
                and struggles of the frontier guards of the Byzantine Empire,
                the "akrites". The klephtic style was born between the end of
                the Byzantine period and the beginning of the Greek Revolution
                that led to the Greek Independence in 1821. This style was
                created by the "kleftes", the heroes who left to live in the
                mountains, leading a revolutionary action against the Ottoman
                tyranny. The klephtic musical style is monophonic, with second
                voices repeating a given rhythmical formula, without any
                harmonic accompaniment. It is composed by love songs, wedding
                songs, songs of exile, songs of freedom, death and sorrows. It
                expresses an important, bloody part of the history and the life
                of the akrites.
              </p>
              <p>
                Musical instruments used in Greek folk songs are the lira and
                laouto (lute), the tambouras and gaida (bagpipe), the zournas
                (shawm), the daouli (drum), the dachares (tambourine), the ziyia
                (paired groups) and the violi (violin).

              <h5>Kantada</h5>
              <p>
                Originated from Kefalonia island and created at the beginning of
                the 19th century, it is a style of romantic serenade music, sung
                with three male voices in chorus, accompanied by guitar or
                mandolin. This style had been influenced by the Italian music
                and soon gained all the Ionian Islands and the rest of Greece.
                In Athens, the cantadha is a little different, accompanied with
                a compania composed of violin, clarinet and laouto.

              <h5>Nisiotika</h5>
              <p>
                This kind of popular songs was born in the Greek islands. Every
                island has its own nissiotiko style and its own way of dancing
                it. Violin, lira, clarinet and guitar accompany the high-pitched
                women voices or the low voice of a single man. Nissiotika are
                still easy to listen in every festival on any Greek island,
                during which a huge group of musicians play life music during
                the whole night.

              <h5>Rebetiko</h5>
              <p>
                This particular and famous style of music in Greece was born in
                the hashish dens and the tekedes, the Turkish style underground
                cafes of the district of Piraeus and the city of Thessaloniki.
                Rembetiko music was spread by the two million Greek refugees
                coming from Asia Minor in 1922, after the destruction of Smyrne
                by the Turks. Homesick and rejected by the Greek population,
                those Greeks who had never lived in Greece and who had lost
                everything, sang about their surroundings, poverty, pain,
                hunger, prison, police oppression, drug addiction, betrayal and
                hashish. Rembetiko was the forbidden music of the outcast, the
                Greek urban blues.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rembetiko slowly in the 1950s came out of the underground
                world and started to be played in the nightclubs of Athens, were
                it became very popular, even if it was despised by the Greek
                people because they saw it as an outcast music. The principal
                instruments of the rembetiko are the bouzouki, an eight string
                oval-shape instrument, the baglama, which looks like a miniature
                bouzouki, and the guitar as well as, for accompaniment, the
                ziyia and the ntefi, a leather small tambourine with little
                metallic plates circling it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some of the greatest and most famous players and singers are
                Vassilis Tsitsanis, Markos Vamvakaris, Marika Ninou and Sotiria
                Bellou. During the 1960s, the rembetiko became unpopular again.
                Young people preferred the new rock music coming from the West
                and the oldest one started listening again to the candhades of
                the 1920s. But this music styles is back in the trends and many
                taverns propose rebetika music bands during week-ends.

              <h5>Origins of Theater</h5>
              <p>
                The origins of Greek theatre lie in the revels of the followers
                of Dionysus, a god of fertility and wine. In keeping with the
                god's special interests, his cult ceremonies are exciting
                occasions. His female devotees, in particular, dance themselves
                into a state of frenzy. Carrying long phallic symbols, known as
                thyrsoi, they tear to pieces and devour the raw flesh of
                sacrificial animals. But the Dionysians also develop a more
                structured form of drama. They dance and sing, in choral form,
                the stories of Greek myth.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the 6th century BC a priest of Dionysus, by the name of
                Thespis, introduces a new element which can validly be seen as
                the birth of theatre. He engages in a dialogue with the chorus.
                He becomes, in effect, the first actor. Actors in the west, ever
                since, have been proud to call themselves Thespians. According
                to a Greek chronicle of the 3rd century BC, Thespis is also the
                first winner of a theatrical award. He takes the prize in the
                first competition for tragedy, held in Athens in 534 BC.
                Theatrical contests become a regular feature of the annual
                festival in honour of Dionysus, held over four days each spring
                and known as the City Dionysia. Four authors are chosen to
                compete. Each must write three tragedies and one satyr play (a
                lascivious farce, featuring the sexually rampant satyrs,
                half-man and half-animal, who form the retinue of Dionysus)
              </p>
              <p>
                The performance of the plays by each author takes a full day, in
                front of a large number of citizens in holiday mood, seated on
                the slope of an Athenian hillside. The main feature of the stage
                is a circular space on which the chorus dance and sing. Behind
                it a temporary wooden structure makes possible a suggestion of
                scenery. At the end of the festival a winner is chosen.

              <h5>The Greek tragedians: 5th century BC</h5>
              <p>
                Only a small number of tragedies survive as full texts from the
                annual competitions in Athens, but they include work by three
                dramatists of genius. The earliest is the heavyweight of the
                trio,Aeschylus. Aeschylus adds a second actor, increasing the
                potential for drama. He first wins the prize for tragedy in 484
                BC. He is known to have written about eighty plays, of which
                only seven survive. One of his innovations is to write the day's
                three tragedies on a single theme, as a trilogy. By good fortune
                three of his seven plays are one such trilogy, which remains one
                of the theatre's great masterpieces - the Oresteia, celebrating
                the achievement of Athens in replacing the chaos of earlier
                times with the rule of law. Sophocles gains his first victory in
                468 BC, defeating Aeschylus. He is credited with adding a third
                actor, further extending the dramatic possibilities of a scene.
                Whereas Aeschylus tends to deal with great public themes, the
                tragic dilemmas in Sophocles are worked out at a more personal
                level. Plots become more complex, characterization more subtle,
                and the personal interaction between characters more central to
                the drama.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although Sophocles in a very long life writes more plays than
                Aeschylus (perhaps about 120), again only seven survive intact.
                Of these Oedipus the King is generally considered to be his
                masterpiece. The youngest of the three great Greek tragedians is
                Euripides. More of his plays survive (19 as opposed to 7 for
                each of the others), but he has fewer victories than his rivals
                in the City Dionysia - in which he first competes in 454 BC.
                Euripides introduces a more unconventional view of Greek myth,
                seeing it from new angles or viewing mythological characters in
                terms of their human frailties. His vision is extremely
                influential in later schools of tragic drama. Racine, for
                example, derives Andromaque and Phèdre from the Andromache and
                Hippolytus of Euripides.

              <h5>The beginning of Greek comedy: 5th century BC</h5>
              <p>
                From 486 BC there is an annual competitition for comedies at
                Athens - held as part of the Lenaea, a three-day festival in
                January. Only one comic author's work has survived from the 5th
                century. Like the first three tragedians, he launches the genre
                with great brilliance. He is Aristophanes, a frequent winner of
                the first prize in the Lenaea (on the first occasion, in 425 BC,
                with the Acharnians). Eleven of his plays survive, out of a
                total of perhaps forty spanning approximately the period 425-390
                BC. They rely mainly on a device which becomes central to the
                tradition of comedy. They satirize contemporary foibles by
                placing them in an unexpected context, whether by means of a
                fantastic plot or through the antics of ridiculous characters.
              </p>
              <p>
                A good example is The Frogs, a literary satire at the expense of
                Euripides. After the death of the great man, Dionysus goes down
                to Hades to bring back his favourite tragedian. A competition
                held down there enables Aristophanes to parody the style of
                Euripides. As a result Dionysus comes back to earth with
                Aeschylus instead. In The Wasps the Athenian love of litigation
                is ridiculed in the form of an old man who sets up a law court
                in his home, to try his dog for stealing cheese. In Lysistrata
                the horrors of war are discussed in a circumstance of extreme

              <h5>The Greek theatre: 4th century BC</h5>
              <p>
                An exclusively Greek contribution to architectural history is
                the raked auditorium for watching theatrical performances
                (appropriately, since the Greeks are also the inventors of
                theatre as a literary form). The masterpieces of Greek drama
                date from the 5th century BC. At that time, in Athens, the
                audience sit on the bare hillside to watch performances on a
                temporary wooden stage. In the 4th century a stone auditorium is
                built on the site, and there is still a theatre there today -
                the theatre of Dionysus. However this is a Roman reconstruction
                from the time of Nero. By then the shape of the stage is a
                semi-circle.

                In the first Greek theatres the stage is a full circle, in
                keeping with the circular dance - the choros - from which the
                theatrical performance has evolved. This stage is called the
                orchestra (orchester, a dancer), because it is the place where
                the chorus sing and dance. Epidaurus, built in about 340 BC,
                provides the best example of a classical Greek theatre. In the
                centre of the orchestra is the stone base on which an altar
                stood, reflecting the religious aspect of theatre in Greece. The
                rising tiers of seats, separated by aisles, provide the pattern
                for the closest part of the auditorium to the stage in nearly
                all subsequent theatres - where these seats are still sometimes
                called the orchestra stalls.
