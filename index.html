        Greece is a country in Southern Europe,bordered to the north by Albania,
        North Macedonia and Bulgaria; to the east by Turkey, and is surrounded
        to the east by the Aegean Sea, to the south by the Cretan and the Libyan
        Seas, and to the west by the Ionian Sea which separates Greece from
        Italy. The country consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland
        jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea.

          <p>
            Western Thrace is a geographic and historical region of Greece,
            between the Nestos and Evros rivers in the northeast of the country;
            East Thrace, which lies east of the river Evros, forms the European
            part of Turkey, and the area to the north, in Bulgaria, is known as
            Northern Thrace. Inhabited since paleolithic times, it has been
            under the political, cultural and linguistic influence of the Greek
            world since the classical era;[2][3] Greeks from the Aegean islands

          <h5>Macedonia</h5>
          <p>
            Macedonia is the largest and second-most-populous Greek region, with
            a population of 2.38 million in 2017. The region is highly
            mountainous, with most major urban centres such as Thessaloniki and
            Kavala being concentrated on its southern coastline. Macedonia
            incorporates most of the territories of ancient Macedon, a kingdom
            ruled by the Argeads and whose most celebrated members were
            Alexander the Great and his father Philip II. The name Macedonia was
            later applied to a number of widely-differing administrative areas
            in the Roman and Byzantine empires, resulting in modern geographical
            Macedonia.The region remains an important economic centre for
            Greece. Macedonia accounts for the majority of Greece's agricultural
            production and is also a major contributor to the country's
            industrial and tourism sectors. Central Macedonia is Greece's
            fourth-most-popular tourist region and the most popular region that
            is not an island.[12] It is home to four UNESCO World Heritage
            sites, including Aigai, one of the ancient Macedonian capital
            cities. Pella, which replaced Aigai as the capital of Macedon in the
            fourth century BC, is also located in Greek Macedonia.

          <h5>Epirus</h5>
          <p>
            Epirus, is a traditional geographic and modern administrative region
            in northwestern Greece. It borders the regions of West Macedonia and
            Thessaly to the east, West Greece to the south, the Ionian Sea and
            Ionian Islands to the west and Albania to the north. It is part of
            the wider historical region of Epirus, which overlaps modern Albania
            and Greece but lies mostly within Greek territory. Epirus, like the
            region as a whole, is rugged and mountainous. It comprises the land
            of the ancient Molossians and Thesprotians. It is largely made up of
            mountainous ridges, part of the Dinaric Alps. The region's highest
            spot is on Mount Smolikas, at an altitude of 2.637 metres above sea
            level. In the east, the Pindus Mountains that form the spine of
            mainland Greece separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly. Most of
            Epirus lies on the windward side of the Pindus. The winds from the
            Ionian Sea offer the region more rainfall than any other part of
            Greece. The Vikos-Aoos and Pindus National Parks are situated in the
            Ioannina Prefecture of the region. Both areas have imposing
            landscapes of dazzling beauty as well as a wide range of fauna and
            flora. The climate of Epirus is mainly alpine. The vegetation is
            made up mainly of coniferous species. The animal life is especially
            rich in this area and includes, among other species, bears, wolves,
            foxes, deer and lynxes.

          <h5>Thessaly</h5>
          <p>
            Thessaly lies in northern Greece and borders the regions of
            Macedonia on the north, Epirus on the west, Central Greece on the
            south and the Aegean Sea on the east. Thessaly is a traditional
            geographic and modern administrative region of Greece, comprising
            most of the ancient region of the same name. Before the Greek Dark
            Ages, Thessaly was known as Aeolia , and appears thus in Homer's
            Odyssey. Thessaly became part of the modern Greek state in 1881,
            after four and a half centuries of Ottoman rule. The capital of the
            region is Larissa. In Homer's epic, the Odyssey, the hero Odysseus
            visited the kingdom of Aeolus, which was the old name for Thessaly.
            The Plain of Thessaly, which lies between Mount Oeta/Othrys and
            Mount Olympus, was the site of the battle between the Titans and the
            Olympians. According to legend, Jason and the Argonauts launched
            their search for the Golden Fleece from the Magnesia Peninsula.

          <h5>Sporades</h5>
          <p>
            The (Northern) Sporades are an archipelago along the east coast of
            Greece, northeast of the island of Euboea, in the Aegean Sea. They
            consist of 24 islands, four of which are permanently inhabited:
            Alonnisos, Skiathos, Skopelos and Skyros. They may also be referred
            to as the Thessalian Sporades. "Sporades" means "those scattered"
            (compare with "sporadic"). From Classical Antiquity the name has
            referred to the Aegean island groups outside the central archipelago
            of the Cyclades. Thracian Sporades: Thasos, Samothrace, Imbros,
            Lemnos and Agios Efstratios Western Sporades: Salamis, Aigina,
            Poros, Hydra, Spetses, and the other islands of the Saronic Gulf and
            the Myrtoan Sea. Eastern Sporades, i.e. the islands of the eastern
            and northeastern Aegean, near the coast of Asia Minor : Samos,
            Ikaria, Lesbos, Chios, Tenedos, Psara, Oinousses and smaller island
            groups Southern Sporades, i.e. the Dodecanese, to which group Samos
            and Ikaria are sometimes appended.

          <h5>Central Greece</h5>
          <p>
            Continental Greece, colloquially known as Roúmeli, is a traditional
            geographic region of Greece. In English the area is usually called
            Central Greece, but the equivalent Greek term is more rarely used.
            It includes the southern part of the Greek mainland (sans the
            Peloponnese), as well as the offshore island of Euboea. Central
            Greece is the most populous geographical region of Greece, with a
            population of 4,591,568 people, and covers an area of 24,818.3 km²,
            making it the second largest of the country. It is located to the
            north of the Peloponnese and to the south of Thessaly and Epirus,
            bordering the Aegean Sea to the east, the Ionian Sea to the west and
            the Corinthian Gulf to the south. Its climate is temperate along its
            coastlines, and dry in the interior.

          <h5>Peloponnese</h5>
          <p>
            The Peloponnese is a peninsula and geographic region in southern
            Greece. It is connected to the central part of the country by the
            Isthmus of Corinth land bridge which separates the Gulf of Corinth
            from the Saronic Gulf. During the late Middle Ages and the Ottoman
            era, the peninsula was known as the Morea , a name still in
            colloquial use in its demotic form. The peninsula is divided among
            three administrative regions: most belongs to the Peloponnese
            region, with smaller parts belonging to the West Greece and Attica
            regions. Since antiquity, and continuing to the present day, the
            Peloponnese has been divided into seven major regions: Achaea
            (north), Corinthia (northeast), Argolis (east), Arcadia (center),
            Laconia (southeast), Messenia (southwest), and Elis (west). Each of
            these regions is headed by a city. The largest city is Patras (pop.
            170,000) in Achaia, followed by Kalamata (pop. 55,000) in Messenia.
            The peninsula has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Its modern
            name derives from ancient Greek mythology, specifically the legend
            of the hero Pelops, who was said to have conquered the entire
            region. The name Peloponnesos means "Island of Pelops". The
            Mycenaean civilization, mainland Greece's (and Europe's) first major
            civilization, dominated the Peloponnese in the Bronze Age from its
            stronghold at Mycenae in the north-east of the peninsula. The
            Mycenean civilization collapsed suddenly at the end of the 2nd
            millennium BC. Archeological research has found that many of its
            cities and palaces show signs of destruction. The subsequent period,
            known as the Greek Dark Ages, is marked by an absence of written
            records.

          <h5>Ionian Islands</h5>
          <p>
            The Ionian Islands are a group of islands in Greece. They are
            traditionally called the Heptanese, i.e. "the Seven Islands", but
            the group includes many smaller islands as well as the seven
            principal ones. As a distinct historic region they date to the
            centuries-long Venetian rule, which preserved them from becoming
            part of the Ottoman Empire, and created a distinct cultural identity
            with many Italian influences. The islands were settled by Greeks at
            an early date, possibly as early as 1200 BC, and certainly by the
            9th century BC. The early Eretrian settlement at Kerkyra was
            displaced by colonists from Corinth in 734 BC. The islands were
            mostly a backwater during Ancient Greek times and played little part
            in Greek politics. The one exception was the conflict between
            Kerkyra and its mother-City Corinth in 434 BC, which brought
            intervention from Athens and triggered the Peloponnesian War. Ithaca
            was the name of the island home of Odysseus in the epic Ancient
            Greek poem the Odyssey by Homer. Attempts have been made to identify
            Ithaki with ancient Ithaca, but the geography of the real island
            cannot be made to fit Homer's description. Archeological
            investigations have revealed interesting findings in both Kefalonia
            and Ithaca.

          <h5>Creta</h5>
          <p>
            Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island
            in the Mediterranean Sea. It is located in the southern part of the
            Aegean Sea separating the Aegean from the Libyan Sea. Crete forms a
            significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece,
            while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own
            poetry and music). It was once the centre of the Minoan civilisation
            (c. 2700–1420 BC), which is the earliest known civilisation in
            Europe. The palace of Knossos lies in Crete.The island is first
            referred to as Kaptara in texts from the Syrian city of Mari dating
            from the 18th century BC,repeated later in Neo-Assyrian records and
            the Bible (Caphtor). It was also known in ancient Egyptian as
            Keftiu, strongly suggesting a similar Minoan name for the island.
            The current name of Crete is thought to be first attested in
            Mycenaean Greek texts written in Linear B, through the words
            ke-re-te. In Ancient Greek, the name Crete first appears in Homer's
            Odyssey.Its etymology is unknown. One proposal derives it from a
            hypothetical Luwian word, *kursatta.

          <h5>Dodecanese</h5>
          <p>
            The Dodecanese , literally "twelve islands" are a group of 15 larger
            plus 150 smaller Greek islands in the southeastern Aegean Sea, off
            the coast of Asia Minor, of which 26 are inhabited. Τhis island
            group generally defines the eastern limit of the Sea of Crete. They
            belong to the wider Southern Sporades island group. The most
            historically important and well-known island, Rhodes, has been the
            area's dominant island since antiquity. Of the others, Kos and
            Patmos are historically the more important; the remaining twelve are
            Agathonisi, Astypalaia, Chalki, Kalymnos, Karpathos, Kasos, Leipsoi,
            Leros, Nisyros, Symi, Tilos, and Kastellorizo. Other islands in the
            chain include Alimia, Arkoi, Chalki, Farmakonisi, Gyali, Kinaros,
            Levitha, Marathos, Nimos, Pserimos, Saria, Strongyli, Syrna and
            Telendos. The Dodecanese have been inhabited since prehistoric
            times. In the Neopalatial period on Crete, the islands were heavily
            Minoanized. Following the downfall of the Minoans, the islands were
            ruled by the Mycenaean Greeks from circa 1400 BC, until the arrival
            of the Dorians circa 1100 BC. It is in the Dorian period that they
            began to prosper as an independent entity, developing a thriving
            economy and culture through the following centuries. By the early
            Archaic period Rhodes and Kos emerged as the major islands in the
            group, and in the 6th century BC the Dorians founded three major
            cities on Rhodes. Together with the island of Kos and the cities of
            Knidos and Halicarnassos on the mainland of Asia Minor, these made
            up the Dorian Hexapolis.

          <h5>Thessaly</h5>
          <p>
            The Cyclades are an island group in the Aegean Sea, southeast of
            mainland Greece and a former administrative prefecture of Greece.
            They are one of the island groups which constitute the Aegean
            archipelago. The name refers to the islands around the sacred island
            of Delos. The largest island of the Cyclades is Naxos. The
            significant Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age Cycladic culture is
            best known for its schematic, flat idols carved out of the islands'
            pure white marble centuries before the great Middle Bronze Age
            Minoan civilization arose in Crete to the south. A distinctive
            Neolithic culture amalgamating Anatolian and mainland Greek elements
            arose in the western Aegean before 4000 BCE, based on emmer and
            wild-type barley, sheep and goats, pigs, and tuna that were
            apparently speared from small boats (Rutter). Excavated sites
            include Saliagos and Kephala (on Kea) with signs of copperworking,
            Each of the small Cycladic islands could support no more than a few
            thousand people, though Late Cycladic boat models show that fifty
            oarsmen could be assembled from the scattered communities (Rutter),
            and when the highly organized palace-culture of Crete arose, the
            islands faded into insignificance, with the exception of Delos,
            which retained its archaic reputation as a sanctuary throughout
            antiquity and until the emergence of Christianity.

          <p>
            The North Aegean islands are a number of disconnected islands in the
            north Aegean Sea, also known as the Northeast Aegean islands,
            belonging to Greece and Turkey. The islands do not form a physical
            chain or group, but are frequently grouped together for tourist or
            administrative purposes. To the south are the Dodecanese islands;
            and to the west are the Cyclades and Sporades islands. Within this
            group, the main islands in the northeastern Aegean Sea and along the
            Turkish coast are the Greek islands of Samos, Ikaria, Chios, Lesbos,
            Lemnos, Agios Efstratios, Psara, Fournoi Korseon, Oinousses and the
            Turkish islands of Imbros, Tenedos and the Rabbit or Tavşan Islands.
            The main islands in the Thracian Sea in the far north are the Greek
            islands of Samothrace and Thasos. From the Mesolithic Age, the North
            Aegean, as indeed the entire Aegean, ceased to be an obstacle and
            became a bridge joining the inhabitants of the region. Shipping,
            trade, economy, culture and social interactions developed in the
            archipelago and surrounding areas on the basis of communication and
            contact between the inhabitants. This was especially true after the
            permanent settlement of the islands 5000 years BC. The islands of
            the north Aegean were in such a position that shipping and trade
            contributed greatly to the development of a significant culture. The
            culture reaches its peak around 3000BC. The growth of settlements
            such as Poliochnis in Lemnos, Emporiou in Chios and Iraiou in Samos,
            amongst others, are evidence of the importance of these centers at
            this time. By ca. 2000 BC the Ionians had installed themselves in
            Chios while Samos and Lesvos are in the hands of the Achaeans. In
            the late 12th and early 11th centuries BC, a time when vast numbers
            of the people moved to Greece, the Aioleis arrived in Lesvos.

            Greek cuisine is a Mediterranean cuisine. Contemporary Greek cookery
            makes wide use of vegetables, olive oil, grains, fish, wine (white
            and red), and meat (including lamb, poultry, veal, beef, rabbit and
            pork). Other important ingredients include olives, pasta (especially
            hyllopites, a kind of pasta similar to tagliatelle), cheese, lemon
            juice, herbs, bread and yoghurt. The most commonly used grain is
            wheat; barley is also used. Common dessert ingredients include nuts,
            honey, fruits, and filo pastries.

            Meze or orektiko is served in restaurants called mezedopoleía,
            served to complement drinks, and in similar establishments known as
            tsipourádika or ouzerí. Many restaurants offer their house pikilía
            (variety) a platter with a smorgasbord of various mezedes that can
            be served immediately to customers looking for a quick or light
            meal. Krasomezédhes (literally "wine-meze") are mezedes that go well

          <div class="col-lg-6">
            The fish dishes are the best ones as Greece is a country surrounded
            by the sea and fishing is a main factor of the Greek agriculture. Of
            course the lobsters, shrimps and red mullets (Barbounia) are the
            most popular, but there are many other kind of fishes like Tsipoura
            (sea bream), Lithrinia (red sea breams) Fagria, Melanouria, Sargi
            and Synagrides all of those fishes belong to the breams and porgies
            family, very tasty grilled or fried. In the summer you will find in
            the Greek taverns many Mackerels (kolioi) But the special fish that
            the Greek love is marida or maridaki the Greek equivalent of the
            north Atlantic Whitebait, this is one of the tastiest fish dishes
            and the best companion for Retsina wine. Other common fish foods in
            Grece are the Kalamaris (squids) , Gopes (bogues) , Htapodi
            (octopus) grilled or boiled with vinegar, Gavros (a kind of anchovy)
            , Galeos (Smooth Hound) tasty fillets that served most with garlic
            salad (scordalia) and beetroots and finally Xifias (Sword fish) a
            very common fish in the Aegean. The Greek bouillabaisse with first
            class fishes most of the times especially in the summer has to be
            ordered a day before in many taverns and restaurants.

          <div class="col-lg-6">
            The most common meats in Greece are pork, lamb, beef, goat, chicken,
            veal and rabbit.Many meat dishes are cooked in tomatoes and red wine
            and others in lemon such as lamb fricasse, which is lamb cooked with
            endives or romaine lettuce and an egg-lemon sauce. Garlic is used
            heavily as are onions and potatoes in the many stews and oven baked
            dishes. There is a pork dish similar to fricasse which is made with
            celery and served in the winter called hirino me celino. Dolmades
            (stuffed grape leaves), kolokithia gemista, (stuffed zuchinni),
            tomates ke peperies gemista (stuffed tomatoes and peppers) and
            laxano gemista (stuffed cabbage) are other examples of stretching
            the meat by using it with rice and vegetables. Pastitsio is like
            lasagna though not as saucy and is made with pasta, ground beef,
            tomatoes, onions and garlic and béchamel sauce. Giovetsi is lamb
            baked with orzo pasta and tomato sauce. If one has been to an Easter
            dinner in Greece you undoubtedly have memories of the men standing
            around watching the lamb turning over the hot coals, usually kept
            company by a kokoretsi, the intestines of the lamb stuffed with
            organ meat and also spit-roasted. Usually this takes place outdoors
            on Easter Sunday.Also popular is gourounopoulo, which is roast
            suckling pig.

          <div class="col-lg-5">
            One of the greatest foods that you can ever taste is the flavorful
            cake with syrup, called “Greek ravani.” It is made from semolina and
            orange syrup. A single visit to a Greek house will probably lead to
            someone offering you a small, decorated, glass plate with syrup on
            it. The treat is considered too sugary, so it is served by the
            spoonful. If you happen to be in Thessaloniki, you have to taste the
            “bougatsa.” A custard pie with phyllo is an amazing breakfast and a
            locals’ favorite. In the Greek pastries of Thessaloniki, you can
            also taste a Greek rice pudding called “rizogalo.” Greek halva is a
            semolina pudding with raisins which takes you to an absolute trip of
            flavors. Depending on the place, Greek halva can also be flour-based
            or sesame-based. A sweet pastry made of very thin layers of phyllo,
            filled with nuts and covered with syrup is, maybe, the most famous
            Greek dessert in the world, baklava. Of course, you cannot visit a
            Greek city, village or island and leave without eating some of the
            most well-known Greek desserts. These Greek honey puffs
            (loukoumades) are small, deep fried balls of dough with honey on
            top.

            <h5>The First written language</h5>
            <p>
              The first written Greek letters were found on baked mud tablets,
              in the remains of the Minoan Knossos Palace of Crete island. This
              language is known as Linear A and it has not been fully decoded
              till today. The most famous example of Linear A is written in the
              famous Phaestos Disc. In the 12th century BC, a new language
              started to develop, called Linear B, where each drawing symbol is
              a consonant-vowel combination. Linear B dates from the Mycenaean
              civilization. In the late 9th and early 8th century BC, the
              language found was based on the Phoenician syllabary, written from
              left to right and back again.

            <h5>The Classical Period</h5>
            <p>
              During the Classical period (6th-4th century BC), the territory of
              Greece was divided in numerous states and each one had its own
              dialect. The two more important dialects were the Ionic and the
              Attic. During this period, Athens established itself as the
              political, economical and cultural centre of the Greek world, and
              therefore the Attic idiom started to be used as a common language.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the expeditions of Alexander the Great, Attic dialect was
              also expanded in the depths of the East and it was spoken by
              millions of people. This gradually led to a mixing dialect which
              was the beginning of the koine, or common dialect, mostly known as
              the Hellenistic koine. This type of language survived through
              centuries and became an official language of the Roman Empire
              later on. The koine is the original language of the New Testament
              and the basis for the development of Medieval and Modern Greek.
              This language was developed all through the Byzantine times.

            <h5>Katharevousa and Dimotiki</h5>
            <p>
              With the creation of the modern Greek State in 1829, the question
              of the language, as an important part of the nation-building
              process, had to be resolved. After about 4 centuries of Ottoman
              occupation, Greece had mostly an oral culture due to all these
              centuries of different dominations. The question was the choice of
              language used in administration and education. One of the
              suggestions, to re-use the Attic language, was very attractive,
              especially because all the Western Europe was charmed by the
              Ancient Greek culture, and it would have been a great stimulus for
              the philhellenes. It proved impossible from a practical point of
              view.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, the Greek scholar Adamantios Korais (1748-1833), suggested to
              reform the spoken language of those times on ancient principals.
              This suggestion was accepted and the katharevoussa (meaning
              purified language) was created. The theme became politicized: a
              distinction rose between the katharevoussa, which became the
              high-style language associated with official functions such as
              governmental affairs, education and religion, and the dimotiki
              language (popular language) used by common people in their
              everyday life. Source: www.greeka.com

          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <h5>20th century language</h5>
            <p>
              n the 20th century, the Greek language debate took a huge
              political significance: academics were sacked for using dimotiki,
              riots were taking place in the streets and a lot of people were
              claiming that katharevoussa was being used as an instrument of
              denying access to education to the common people. Nationalist
              governments like the dictator of the Junta, Ioannis Papadopoulos,
              favoured katharevoussa. The struggle between the proponents of
              dimotiki and katharevoussa riased various social attitudes and
              political positions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The theme was eventually solved in 1976, with actions of the after
              dictatorship government. Dimotiki language was adopted in
              education and administration and it has been kept since then as
              the formal language of modern Greece. The last thing worth
              mentioning is that most regions in Greece have their local oral
              dialects, never used as writing means. Every region has of course
              its local accent.

              The religion of Greek people is an important aspect of the Greek culture. The Greek population in mainland Greece and the Greek islands is Christian Orthodox per 98%. The religion of rest of the population is Muslims, Catholic and Jewish. Greece and Russia are the only countries to have such a great proportion of Orthodox population.

              According to the history of Orthodoxy, the first who came in the Greek territory to preach Christianity was Saint Paul in 49 AD. Although many people converted to Christianity in the centuries that followed, this didn't become an official religion until the Emperor Constantine the Great established Christianity as the official religion of the Byzantine Empire.

            <p>
              In 1054 AD, Christianity was divided in Eastern and Western Church, the Orthodox and the Catholics. This division was called "The Schism" and was the result of long disputes between the Pope of Rome and the Patriarch of Constantinople. The disputes referred to the celibacy of the clergy (Catholic priests had to remain unmarried, whereas the orthodox priests could marry before becoming ordained), receiving the Holy Communion and the wording of the Creed: for the Orthodox the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father, whereas Rome added and the Son (filioque). However, the largest problem between the two Churches was the demand of the Pope to have full control over the Eastern Patriarchs (of Constantinople, of Alexandreia and of Antioche).

A percentage of 1,3% are Greek citizens of Muslim religion, mostly people living in Thrace who were not affected by the population exchange of 1922 between the Greeks of Asia Minor and the Turks of Greece. The rest 0,7% are Catholics, Jewish, Jehovah's Witnesses and others. Most Catholics live on the island of Syros, a remain from the Venetian occupation of Cyclades in the Medieval times.
